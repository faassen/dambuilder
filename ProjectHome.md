It is the future and the world is in trouble. The sea level is
rising. Trash is everywhere. Genetically engineered animals have gone
on a rampage.

Finally, Dutch genetic engineers have created a special animal to
limit the damage. This animal is intended to be a hero: you.

You are a beaver. Your mission: to build a dam and protect the land
from the rising sea as long as possible, so that the areas can be
safely evacuated! Clean up the sea while you're at it.

Gather trash in the sea. Go to the nano-assembler charging device, and
charge up on building materials.

Protect your dam! Animals damage your dam and create leaks. Chase them
off and fix any leaks!
