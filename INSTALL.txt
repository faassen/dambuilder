Installation
============

On Windows
----------

Unpack the dambuilder-0.9.zip file. Click on 'dambuilder.exe'. That's it.

On Linux
--------

Requirements:

* Python 2.4

* Pygame 1.7.1

* ODE 0.8

* PyODE 1.2.0

* Pygame dependencies, as Ubuntu packages (libSDL with all options
  Pygame can use):

  * libsdl1.2-dev

  * libsdl-ttf2.0.0

  * libsdl-ttf2.0-dev (this doesn't seem to pull in libsdl-ttf2.0.0 on Ubuntu!)

  * libsdl-image1.2-dev

  * libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

  * libsmpeg-dev (probably not strictly necessary)

Start the game by running 'run_game.py' or 'dambuilder_game.py'.

Note that the list of requirements above seems ominous, but if you're
in Linux, you can use 'buildout' to make things go a bit more
automatic. See the explanation below.

Source on Windows
-----------------

To use the source, you need the following installed:

* Python 2.4

* PyGame 1.7.1

* PyODE 1.2.0

You can then start the game by clicking on run_game.py or
dambuilder_game.py.

Extensions that can be built with Buildout
------------------------------------------

Note that on Linux (and likely MacOS X as well) you can build and
install the following extensions automatically (all in the Dambuilder
project directory, no need to become root), using buildout:

* Pygame 1.7.1

* ODE 0.8

* PyODE 1.2.0

To do this you need to have the buildout source package for
Dambuilder. This includes an 'install' directory and a special version
of zc.recipe.cmmi. Then::

  $ cd dambuilder

  $ python2.4 bootstrap.py

  $ bin/buildout

And wait. If pygame complains that it cannot find all the SDL-related
libraries, Ctrl-C out and install the dev packages listed above first.

After a buildout, you can run the game using:

  $ bin/dambuilder
