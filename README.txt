HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
--------------------

It is the future and the world is in trouble. The sea level is
rising. Trash is everywhere. Genetically engineered animals have gone
on a rampage.

Finally, Dutch genetic engineers have created a special animal to
limit the damage. This animal is intended to be a hero: you.

You are a beaver. Your mission: to build a dam and protect the land
from the rising sea as long as possible, so that the areas can be
safely evacuated! Clean up the sea while you're at it.

Gather trash in the sea. Go to the nano-assembler charging device, and
charge up on building materials. 

Protect your dam! Animals damage your dam and create leaks. Chase them
off and fix any leaks!

Keys:

* left: go left

* right: go right

* up: climb the dam, swim up

* down: climb the dam, swim down

* spacebar, on top of the dam: build up the dam

* spacebar, near a leak: repair leaks

* spacebar, at charging device: charge up on building materials

* alt: jump

* enter: change material selection

Eventually your dam must succumb to the rising sea. Your mission is to
hold out as long as possible. You lose the game when the water level
on the land reaches above 10. Your final score is determined by
the sea level at the end of the game.
