Living beings
=============

A living entity is in a different position depending on where in the world
it is. Let's first set up a world::

   >>> from dambuilder import world, living
   >>> w = world.World()

Let's create a beaver (a living) that has a body that is in this world::

   >>> beaver = living.Living(MockGeomSphere(3, 0.5, 0, 0.5))

Since the beaver is half its body height up, it is walking::

   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.WALKING
   True

If the beaver were in the air, it would be considered to be flying::

   >>> beaver.geom.y = 1.5
   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.FLYING
   True

Let's put him on the ground again, but let's put in a little bit of water in
the world::

   >>> beaver.geom.y = 0.5
   >>> water = w.get_waterlevel(1) 
   >>> water.level = 0.1

This waterlevel is considered to be so low the beaver can just walk
through it::
   
   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.WALKING
   True

The waterlevel can also be higher though, making the beaver wade::

   >>> water.level = 0.5
   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.WADING
   True

The waterlevel can also be so high that the beaver is actually swimming::

   >>> water.level = 1.5
   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.SWIMMING
   True

If the beaver is above the water level, he would be flying::

   >>> beaver.geom.y = 2
   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.FLYING
   True

Now let's create a dam at position 6, 3 meters high and 1 meter wide::

   >>> w.add_dam('dam', MockGeomBox(6., 1.5, 1., 3.))
   <dambuilder.dam.Dam object at ...>

We will move the beaver inside the dam::

   >>> beaver.geom.x = 6.
   >>> beaver.geom.y = 0.5
 
It is now in the middle of the dam, so we get an ILLEGAL state::

   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.ILLEGAL
   True
 
Let's put the beaver on the dam. The beaver is now walking::

   >>> beaver.geom.y = 3.5
   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.WALKING
   True

If the beaver is above the dam, it is flying::

   >>> beaver.geom.y = 4
   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.FLYING
   True

Let's raise the waterlevel before the dam, so the dam becomes submerged::

   >>> w.get_waterlevel(8).level = 5

The beaver would now be swimming::

   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.SWIMMING
   True

Let's lower the waterlevel and the beaver somewhat so the beaver is wading
on top of the dam::

   >>> w.get_waterlevel(8).level = 3.5
   >>> beaver.geom.y = 3.5
   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.WADING
   True

Maybe the other side of the dam is flooded::

   >>> w.get_waterlevel(8).level = 0
   >>> w.get_waterlevel(1).level = 5
   >>> beaver.get_state(w) is living.SWIMMING
   True

If the beaver is standing near the dam, we need to know too. Let's place
him near the dam::

   >>> beaver.geom.x = 5.
   >>> beaver.geom.y = 0.5

   >>> beaver.near_dam(w) is not None
   True   

Now let's move him to the other side of the dam::

   >>> beaver.geom.x = 7
   >>> beaver.near_dam(w) is not None
   True

Let's move the beaver away from the dam again::

   >>> beaver.geom.x = 1
   >>> beaver.near_dam(w) is not None
   False
   >>> beaver.geom.x = 8
   >>> beaver.near_dam(w) is not None
   False

If the beaver is near the dam but above it, he's not considered to be
near a dam::

   >>> beaver.geom.x = 5.
   >>> beaver.geom.y = 5.
   >>> beaver.near_dam(w) is not None
   False

He's floating above the dam, so he isn't on the dam either::

   >>> beaver.on_dam(w) is not None
   False

Let's place him on the dam now::

   >>> beaver.geom.y = 3.5
   >>> beaver.on_dam(w) is not None
   True
